######(Object Oriented Content Management System)
version 1.0-alpha2-pre


The goal of this project is to make a full featured object oriented CMS.
Using the MVC architecture, this hopes to bring a better and modular system.

At first run, run the first-run.sql and fill the required information at framework/model/db-access.php.
The framework directory is protected by a .htaccess file, but it may be best to set access restriction manually
as it contains sensitive information.

To-do List:
* Special widgets (title, footer)
* Comment Box
* Admin panel
